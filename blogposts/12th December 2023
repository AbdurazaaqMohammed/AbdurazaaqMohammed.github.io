<h2>Userscripts - quickly getting and formatting info from Google Play Store</h2>
<p>I recently decided to write a userscript to quickly copy and get information from Google Play app pages, and format it in the style required by Mobilism. The first issue I encountered was almost everything I tried to access via QuerySelector being null. I quickly realized this was due to elements in the "About app" popup only loading when the popup is opened. I had to first open this popup. The code inefficiency started here, as the button used to open this popup occurs several times on the page, and is also used for the review section. The order is also not consistent, so I had to use a for statement to click all the buttons, which works. My first version of the script used some awful string concatenation, which I later divided into sections for each piece of information. I then discovered that Google Play sometimes switches the text of the changelog box with the privacy info box, but the divs used are different, so I had to use a .startsWith to check if it's really the changelog or not and adjust the div as necessary. Then I found out apparently .textContent is faster than .innerText, so I switched most of my stuff to it. I also added code to remove emojis from the description and changelog because Mobilism does not allow them.</p>
